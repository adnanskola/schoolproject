		<h1 class="text1">Changes in the Polar Zone due to Climate Change</h1>
		<p class="text2">In the last 35 years, the temperature at the poles has increased significantly. From 1971 to 2019, the temperature of the poles increased by 3.1 degrees Celsius. It hasn't increased that much in the past millions of years. <mark>Are we going to lose the Poles soon?</mark></p>

		According to Dirk Notz, Director of the research group "Meereis im Erdsystem", Max-Planck-Institut, even before 2050 we will experience a summer in which the Northpole will have no ice. The Southpole isnt any better tho. On the 6th February 2020, record-high temperatures have been measured on the south pole, 18,3 Degrees Celsius (64,94 Degrees Fahrenheit), the Ice is melting 6 times faster than in 1980.<br>
		From 1992 to 2022, Antartica lost about 2.670 Billion tons of ice, that increased the sea level by 7,4 millimeters.
		</p>
		<mark class="text3">Is it too late to do something?</mark>
		<p class="text4">
			There are some changes which are impossible to revert, for example the loss of some shelf ice areas*, but there is MUCH which can be stopped or even reverted.
		</p>
		<p>
			*shelf ice = Big ice area that is floating in the water with atleast 2m height.
		</p>
		<mark class="text3">
			Are all changes negative?
		</mark>
		<p class="text4">
			Although we would lose the poles through these changes, which is horrible, some people see the chance to make money. If there is no ice on the poles anymore it allows boats to drive there and get to their destination faster. It also allows us to get Oil which is under the water that is under the ice.
		</p>
		<mark class="text3">What can you do against it?</mark>
		<p class="text4">
			- protest<br>
			You can get your country and its goverment to do something against the climate change.<br>
			<br>
			- eat less meat and dairy products.<br>
			If you eat less meat and dairy products, less CO2 will be released because the demand for meat and dairy will fall which means there will be less animals, which release CO2.<br>
			<br>
			- fly less.<br>
			a flight from London to Amsterdam alone releases 58kg of CO2<br>
			<br>
			- drive less.<br>
			Instead of driving your car, take the bus,train or even a bike. You release less CO2 by doing this.<br>
			<br>
			- Dont destroy forests.<br>
			Dont throw trash away in the forests and dont destroy the trees, they are important for our survival.<br>
			<br>
			<mark>There is also much which you can do while sitting comfortably</mark>, z.B:<br>
			- Donate to Team Trees: <a href="https://teamtrees.org/" target="_blank" class="button1">Click here</a><br>
			Team Trees plants a tree every time someone donates a dollar. 1 Dollar = 0,94 Euro<br>
			<br>
			- Donate to Team Seas: <a href="https://teamseas.org/" target="_blank" class="button1">Click here</a><br>
			Team Seas removes 1 pound of trash from the ocean every time someone donates a dollar. 1 Dollar = 0,94 Euro.<br>
			<br>
			- search with Ecosia: <a href="https://ecosia.org" target="_blank" class="button1">Click here</a><br>
			Use Ecosia instead of Google when searching the internet. Ecosia plants a tree every time someone searches with its search engine.
